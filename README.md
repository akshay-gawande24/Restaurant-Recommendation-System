#  Restaurant Recommendation System

This project is an intelligent restaurant recommendation web app that helps users discover the best dining options based on their preferences like city, cuisine, food item, and distance.

## Objective

To recommend top-rated restaurants using filtered user input criteria, such as:
-  City
-  Cuisine Type
-  Specific Food Item
-  Maximum Distance (in kilometers)

## How It Works

The system allows users to:
1. Select a City(e.g., Ahmedabad)
2. Choose a Cuisine (e.g., Chinese, Indian)
3. Enter a Food Item (e.g., Biryani)
4. Set a Maximum Distance
5. Click on Find to get the best-matched restaurants

## Output Example

| Restaurant Name   | City       | Cuisine | Food Item | Rating | Address                    | Map  |
